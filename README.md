## Description ##

This is an application that dynamically generates a README.md file based on user input. I started this project because I needed a tool that helped me get past my README writers block that I get every time I sit down to write a README. The entire application is written in javascript and utilizes NPM with the Inquirer package along with the built-in File System package("fs"). For details on [how to install](#installation) or [how to use](#usage), see below.

This README was largely generated by this README Generator, though minor edits were made. To see the original that is entirely generated, click [here](./generated-readme-example.md)
