## Description ##

This is an application that dynamically generates a README.md file based on user input. I started this project because I needed a tool that helped me get past my README writers block that I get every time I sit down to write a README. The entire application is written in javascript and utilizes node and npm.   

### Installation ###

1. This project requires Node.js. If you don't have Node.js installed you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Download the README-Generator-master.zip file from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NTKonzen/README-Generator) and unzip it

1. Move the unzipped folder to your preferred location in your file system
1. Navigate to the repository in your preferred command terminal
1. Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies in the package.json file
1. Run 'node index.js' and follow the instructions 

### Usage

1. You will be prompted with a series of questions about yourself and your project
1. Answer each question to the best of your ability
1. Your README file will be generated in the 'Generated READMEs' folder
1. A new LICENSE file will ge generated in the same folder that the program is run. Be sure to include that in your project

### Tests

* Try including or not including a semicolon at the end of the installation or test steps. Notice both do the same thing!
* Run the program twice and try a different license option each time
