## Description ##

This application generates README files dynamically with given user input. I started this project because I needed a tool that helped me get past my README writers block that I get every time I sit down to write a README. The entire application is written in javascript and utilizes node and npm.

### Installation ###

1. Download the .zip file of the repository from my GitHub
1. Navigate to the repository in your preferred command terminal
1. Run 'node index.js' and follow the instructions
